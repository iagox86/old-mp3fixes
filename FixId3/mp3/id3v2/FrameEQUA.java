/** Equalisation Frame
 * This is another subjective, alignment frame. It allows the user to
 * predefine an equalisation curve within the audio file. There may only be
 * one "EQUA" frame in each tag.
 *
 * <Header of 'Equalisation', ID: "EQUA">
 * Adjustment bits $xx
 *
 * The 'adjustment bits' field defines the number of bits used for
 * representation of the adjustment. This is normally $10 (16 bits) for
 * MPEG 2 layer I, II and III and MPEG 2.5. This value may not be $00.
 *
 * This is followed by 2 bytes + ('adjustment bits' rounded up to the nearest
 * byte) for every equalisation band in the following format, giving a
 * frequency range of 0 - 32767Hz:
 *
 * Increment/decrement %x (MSB of the Frequency)
 * Frequency (lower 15 bits)
 * Adjustment $xx (xx ...)
 *
 * The increment/decrement bit is 1 for increment and 0 for decrement.
 * The equalisation bands should be ordered increasingly with reference to
 * frequency. All frequencies don't have to be declared. The equalisation
 * curve in the reading software should be interpolated between the values in
 * this frame. Three equal adjustments for three subsequent frequencies. A
 * frequency should only be described once in the frame.
